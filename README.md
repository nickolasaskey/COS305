Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
For this assignment, I was working with Artemis Financial, a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers; these include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance.  They wanted to modernize operations and create a safe and secure site to accomplish their goals.  My job, as part of the Global Rain team, was to identify any security vulnerabilities.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I did a good job at manually inspecting the vulnerability report for false positives; the websites that I found online helped a lot in understanding how or why false positives appear in the first place.  It is important to run these checks and do the manual inspection because these breaches of security can cost companies millions, as well as a huge loss of trust between the company and their client base.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The vulnerability assessment was challenging at first, but the more that you examine the assessment the easier it is to comprehend and adjust.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I increased layers of security by identifying the weak spots of the program with the dependency check and creating the vulnerability assessment to make aware of the areas that need stronger security, and how we can go about increasing the security in those areas.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
Every time that I completed my check and made the changes that I needed to make, I would rerun the dependency check and ensure that the changes I made didn't just create more vulnerabilites in the program. If they did, though, it is important to do another manual inspection and change what needs to be made.  We only stop doing dependency checks when we are sure that we have not created any more vulnerabilities.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
There are several websites, as well as the Maven dependency check site itself, that give very useful tools and resources for completing assignments.  These websites are easy to understand, but can be a little bit of a challenge to navigate at times. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
It would be important to show them my ability to run the check and examine the program; I think any employer would want to see that I have experience with this type of assignment and can understand and utilize tools to complete the job in a timely manner.
